<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Recovery Ventilator Cores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crossflow</li><li>Counter-flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy recovery ventilator cores are classified into two main types: crossflow and counter-flow. In crossflow systems, the supply and exhaust air streams move perpendicular to each other, allowing for efficient heat exchange. On the other hand, counter-flow systems involve the air streams moving in opposite directions, maximizing heat transfer efficiency. Both types of cores are used in energy recovery ventilators to help reduce energy consumption and maintain optimal indoor air quality. Each type offers unique benefits and applications depending on the specific needs of the building or facility.</p></p>
