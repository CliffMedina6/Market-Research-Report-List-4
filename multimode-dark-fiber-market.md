<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Dark Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step-index Multimode Fiber</li><li>Graded-index Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multimode dark fiber refers to optical fiber cables that can transmit multiple light signals simultaneously. There are two main types of multimode fiber in the market: step-index multimode fiber and graded-index multimode fiber. Step-index fiber has a core with a uniform refractive index, while graded-index fiber has a core with varying refractive index that decreases towards the outer edges. Graded-index fiber allows for better dispersion and reduced modal dispersion, making it more suitable for high-speed data transmission over longer distances compared to step-index fiber.</p></p>
