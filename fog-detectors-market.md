<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fog Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardwired Detectors</li><li>Battery-operated Detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fog detectors come in two main types: hardwired detectors and battery-operated detectors. Hardwired detectors are connected directly to a building's electrical system, providing continuous power and reliable detection of fog or smoke. Battery-operated detectors, on the other hand, are independent of external power sources and rely on replaceable batteries for operation. Both types of detectors serve the same purpose of detecting fog or smoke in indoor environments, but they differ in their power source and installation method.</p></p>
