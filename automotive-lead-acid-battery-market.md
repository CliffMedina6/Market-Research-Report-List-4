<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Lead Acid Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VRLA Battery</li><li>Flooded Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive lead acid battery market is divided into two main types: VRLA (valve-regulated lead-acid) batteries and flooded batteries. VRLA batteries are maintenance-free and sealed, making them a popular choice for modern vehicles. Flooded batteries require regular maintenance and have a vent to release gases during charging, making them less suitable for some applications. Both types of batteries are widely used in the automotive industry, with VRLA batteries being favored for their convenience and flooded batteries for their lower cost.</p></p>
