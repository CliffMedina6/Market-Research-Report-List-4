<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Vacuum Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-sealed</li><li>Water-ring</li><li>DryVacuum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical vacuum boosters are devices used to increase the efficiency of vacuum systems. There are three main types: oil-sealed, water-ring, and dry vacuum boosters. </p><p>Oil-sealed vacuum boosters use oil to lubricate and seal the rotors, allowing for higher vacuum levels. Water-ring vacuum boosters use a ring of water to create the vacuum, making them efficient and environmentally friendly. Dry vacuum boosters do not require any lubrication or sealing fluid, making them clean and low-maintenance options for certain applications. Each type has its own advantages and is suited for different industries and applications.</p></p>
