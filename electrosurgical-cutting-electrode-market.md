<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Cutting Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Electrosurgery</li><li>Monopolar Electrosurgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrosurgical cutting electrodes are commonly used in surgical procedures to precisely cut tissues using electrical current. There are two main types of electrosurgery: bipolar and monopolar. In bipolar electrosurgery, the electrical current flows between two electrodes located close to each other, allowing for more controlled cutting with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. In monopolar electrosurgery, the electrical current flows from the active electrode to a dispersive electrode on the patient's body, allowing for deeper tissue penetration but with potential for more collateral damage.</p></p>
