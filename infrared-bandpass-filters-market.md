<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Bandpass Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wideband</li><li>Narrowband</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared bandpass filters can be categorized into two main market types based on their filter width: wideband and narrowband. Wideband filters allow a broader range of infrared wavelengths to pass through, making them suitable for applications requiring a wide range of spectral coverage. Narrowband filters, on the other hand, only allow a very specific range of wavelengths to pass through, providing high spectral purity and resolution for precise applications. Both wideband and narrowband filters cater to different requirements in the infrared spectrum market.</p></p>
