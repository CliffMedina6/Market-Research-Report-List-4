<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Storage Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Wall</li><li>Double Wall</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar storage tanks are categorized into single wall and double wall tanks based on their construction and design. Single wall tanks consist of a single layer of material, making them more cost-effective but less resistant to leaks and corrosion. On the other hand, double wall tanks feature an additional layer of protection, providing increased durability and safety against leaks. Both types of tanks are commonly used for storing solar energy generated by solar panels for later use in heating systems or other applications.</p></p>
