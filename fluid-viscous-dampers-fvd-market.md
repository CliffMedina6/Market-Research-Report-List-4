<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Viscous Dampers (FVD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Type</li><li>Non-linear Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid viscous dampers (FVD) are used in engineering to dampen vibrations. In the linear type market, these dampers provide a constant damping force regardless of the velocity. On the other hand, in the non-linear type market, the damping force varies based on the velocity or displacement of the structure. Linear type FVDs are simpler and more predictable, while non-linear type FVDs offer more complex and flexible damping characteristics, making them suitable for a wider range of applications. Both types cater to different needs in the vibration control industry.</p></p>
