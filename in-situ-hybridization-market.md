<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In-Situ Hybridization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radioactive isotopes</li><li>Non-radioactive labels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-Situ Hybridization Market offers two types of labels for detecting specific DNA or RNA sequences within cells: Radioactive isotopes and Non-radioactive labels. Radioactive isotopes like 32P or 35S emit radiation for detection, while Non-radioactive labels like digoxigenin or fluorescein are safer alternatives. The Radioactive isotopes market is declining due to safety concerns and regulatory restrictions, leading to a growing demand for Non-radioactive labels. Non-radioactive labels are easier to handle, dispose of, and offer comparable sensitivity and specificity for in-situ hybridization applications.</p></p>
