<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biosafety Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Class II A Type</li><li>Class II B Type</li><li>Class III Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biosafety cabinets play a crucial role in laboratories to protect workers, samples, and the environment from biohazards. There are three main types of biosafety cabinets: Class II A Type, Class II B Type, and Class III Type. Class II A Type cabinets provide protection to workers, samples, and the environment by filtering the air before recirculating it into the laboratory. Class II B Type cabinets offer similar protection but also redirect the exhaust air outside the laboratory. Class III Type cabinets provide the highest level of protection by enclosing the work area in a gas-tight manner.</p></p>
