<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spiral Welded Pipes and Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side Welding</li><li>Double Side Welding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spiral welded pipes and tubes are categorized into two main types based on the welding method used: single side welding and double side welding. In single side welding, the weld is performed on only one side of the pipe, while in double side welding, the weld is performed on both sides. Single side welding is commonly used for thinner pipes, while double side welding is preferred for thicker pipes where higher strength and durability are required. Both welding methods have their own advantages and are utilized based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
