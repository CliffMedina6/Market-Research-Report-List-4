<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrile Cellular Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell Rubber</li><li>Semi-closed Cell Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed cell rubber is a type of nitrile cellular rubber that has completely closed cells, preventing the passage of air or water. This results in a material with high compression strength and insulation properties. Semi-closed cell rubber, on the other hand, has partially closed cells that allow for some air or water permeation. This results in a material that is more flexible and can conform to uneven surfaces, making it suitable for applications where compression and sealing are required.</p></p>
