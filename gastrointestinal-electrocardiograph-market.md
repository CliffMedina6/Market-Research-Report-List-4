<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastrointestinal Electrocardiograph Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrogastroenterography (EGEG)</li><li>Cutaneous Electrogastrography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gastrointestinal Electrocardiograph market includes two main types of technologies: Electrogastroenterography (EGEG) and Cutaneous Electrogastrography. EGEG involves placing electrodes directly on the skin to measure electrical activity in the stomach, providing insight into gastric motility. Cutaneous Electrogastrography, on the other hand, involves measuring stomach activity through electrodes placed on the skin of the abdomen. Both methods are used to diagnose disorders such as gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia by analyzing the electrical signals in the gastrointestinal tract.</p></p>
