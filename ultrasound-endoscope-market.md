<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasound Endoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft Endoscope</li><li>Rigid Endoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasound endoscopes can be categorized into two main types based on their structure: soft endoscopes and rigid endoscopes. Soft endoscopes have a flexible shaft that allows for easier navigation through the body's curves and twists, making them ideal for procedures in areas that are harder to reach. Rigid endoscopes, on the other hand, have a straight and inflexible shaft, providing better stability and control during procedures. Both types of endoscopes play a crucial role in medical imaging and diagnostics.</p></p>
