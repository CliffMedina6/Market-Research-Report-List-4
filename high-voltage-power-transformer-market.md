<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Power Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Type Transformer</li><li>Oil-Immersed Transformer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High voltage power transformers are essential for transmitting electricity efficiently. There are two main types of transformers: dry-type and oil-immersed. Dry-type transformers use solid insulation, making them more environmentally friendly and suitable for indoor installation where fire safety is a concern. Oil-immersed transformers use oil as a coolant and insulator, making them more efficient and suitable for outdoor use. Both types serve the purpose of stepping up or down voltage levels for power transmission and distribution.</p></p>
