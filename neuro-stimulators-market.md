<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Neuro-stimulators</li><li>Non-invasive Neuro-stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuro-stimulators are devices used to treat various neurological conditions by stimulating specific areas of the brain or nerves. Invasive neuro-stimulators involve surgically implanting electrodes to deliver electrical impulses, while non-invasive neuro-stimulators use external devices to stimulate nerves without requiring surgery. Invasive neuro-stimulators are often used for conditions such as chronic pain or Parkinson's disease, while non-invasive neuro-stimulators are more commonly used for conditions like depression or migraines. Both types of neuro-stimulators play a crucial role in managing neurological disorders and improving patients' quality of life.</p></p>
