<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Supplied-air Respirators (SARs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Pressure Type</li><li>Negative-Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Supplied-air respirators (SARs) are categorized into two main types - positive-pressure and negative-pressure. Positive-pressure SARs work by pushing clean air into the mask, creating positive pressure in the mask and preventing outside contaminants from entering. On the other hand, negative-pressure SARs rely on the wearer's inhalation to draw air through the mask, potentially allowing contaminants to enter if the seal is not tight. Both types are important in different work environments and should be selected based on the specific requirements of the job.</p></p>
